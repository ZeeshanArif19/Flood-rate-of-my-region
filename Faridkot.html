<h3>What to Do During a Flood</h3><br>
<h5>1.Follow Evacuation Orders</h5>
<p class="p1">If authorities issue evacuation orders, promptly follow them to ensure your safety and that of your family.</p>
<h5>2.Move to Higher Ground</h5>
<p class="p1">Seek higher ground away from flood-prone areas, preferably a sturdy building on elevated terrain, to minimize the risk of being submerged.</p>
<h5>3.Avoid Walking or Driving Through Flooded Areas</h5>
<p class="p1">Never attempt to walk or drive through flooded areas, as water currents can be deceptively strong and road conditions may be compromised.</p>
<h5>4.Listen to Emergency Alerts</h5>
<p class="p1">Pay attention to emergency alerts and instructions from local authorities to stay updated on the evolving situation and take necessary precautions.</p>
<h5>5.Stay Away from Power Lines and Electrical Equipment</h5>
<p class="p1">Avoid contact with power lines and electrical equipment, as they could be energized or pose other hazards during flooding.</p>
